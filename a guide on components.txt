A quick guide on ship components:

===========================================
1. Thrusters

Thrusters are relatively simple, they just push
you forward or in a direction.

Your inputs are as follows (in order):
- Forward; Active when user presses the forward key
- Left; Active when user presses the 'left turn' key
- Right; Active when user presses the 'right turn' key

Your outputs are as follows (in order):
- Left thruster group
- Right thruster group

If both thruster groups are powered, the ship will move
forward. However, if only one group is powered, the ship
will rotate, e.g if you activate the left thrusters you
will turn clockwise.

===========================================
2. Railguns

Railguns are a bit more tricky. They generate heat, so
it is dangerous to fire too much.

Your inputs are as follows (in order):
- Fire signal; active when user is pressing the 'fire' key
- Left; when the user is pressing the 'left fire' key
- Right; when the user is pressing the 'right fire' key
- Overheating signal; active when railgun is overheating

Your outputs are as follows (in order):
- Forward Fire; fires the forward railguns
- Left Fire; fires the railguns to the left of the bridge
- Right Fire; fires the railguns to the right of the bridge

While you can easily fire all railguns at once, this will
generate many times more heat, and if your circuit is wired
safely this will cause it to shoot slower.
