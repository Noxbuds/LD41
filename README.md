-RED SHIRT ENGINEER-

Shortly after a scientific expedition arrived at an interesting spatial anomaly, hostile ships start warping in. Without any communication whatsoever, they open fire, and target your shipâ€™s systems, and many crew members are injured. You, the enigmatic engineer wearing a red shirt, must repair the damage done to each system, and pilot the ship to safety!
